        <ol type="a">
          <li>The ShipBob &ldquo;Services&rdquo; include:<br>
            (a) providing technology solutions to support the receipt, counting, storage, picking and packaging (&ldquo;fulfillment&rdquo;) of physical goods sold by you (the &ldquo;Goods&rdquo;) pursuant to your order (&ldquo;Order&rdquo;) by ShipBob or by independent third-party warehouses using the ShipBob&rsquo;s proprietary Warehouse Management System (&ldquo;WMS&rdquo;) and referred to as ShipBob Fulfillment Network Providers (&ldquo;SFN Providers&rdquo;);<br>
            (b) providing technology solutions to support the shipment of the Goods by independent third-party carriers (each, a &ldquo;Carrier&rdquo;);<br>
            (c) access to ShipBob&rsquo;s proprietary platform and associated technology, in object code format only, which is made available by ShipBob to you, for purposes of managing Goods, submitting Orders for Goods and fulfilling Orders (the &ldquo;ShipBob Platform&rdquo;); and<br>
            (d) all data, reports, text, images, sounds, video, and content, including any offline reports, pricing matrices, or other content, made available to you through any of the foregoing (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Content&rdquo;), including, in each case, all modifications and updates.</li>
          <li>We may separately enter into a Warehousing and Fulfillment Pricing Agreement (&ldquo;Fulfillment Agreement&rdquo;) with you, which may modify the terms of the Services. If we do so, the terms of the Fulfillment Agreement shall take precedence over any conflicting terms of this Agreement. The terms of any Fulfillment Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. In our sole discretion, we also may provide you additional Services as set forth in the Excel and Bulk Upload and Promotional/Volume Spikes Agreement (&ldquo;Volume Agreement&rdquo;). If we do provide these additional Services, the terms of the Volume Agreement shall be incorporated into this Agreement. The terms of the Volume Agreement shall take precedence over any conflicting terms in this Agreement.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>SFN Providers&rsquo; Responsibilities.</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>You understand and agree that ShipBob provides a technology platform connecting you with SFN Providers who are responsible for warehousing, picking and packing, and fulfilling your Goods. The Services offered by ShipBob pursuant to this Agreement do not include any of these services when your Goods are serviced by an SFN Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ShipBob may also provide warehouse, pick or pack, or fulfillment services for you, in which case this Agreement will govern ShipBob as a technology platform provider and as a performing SFN Provider.</li>
          <li>ShipBob will help facilitate the filing of claims with SFN Providers for Goods that are lost or damaged by an SFN Provider, but ShipBob is not responsible for any shrinkage, loss, or damage caused by an SFN Provider. All such claims shall be subject to ShipBob&rsquo;s Operations Errors Policy.</li>
          <li>When such warehouse, pick or pack, and fulfillment services are performed by an SFN Provider, ShipBob will use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the SFN Provider&rsquo;s assent to the following terms: (a) SFN Provider must utilize ShipBob&rsquo;s proprietary Warehouse Management System and follow ShipBob&rsquo;s fulfillment policies; (b) that the SFN Provider has the necessary approvals, authorities, licenses, and insurance to provide the fulfillment services; (c) that the SFN Provider will comply with all federal, state, provincial, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances including, but not limited to, safety-related laws and regulations; (d) that the SFN Provider accepts the duty of care consistent with all applicable industry best management practices, industry guidelines, and the care a reasonably careful person would exercise under like circumstances and (d) that the SFN Provider will maintain insurance as required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ShipBob does not guarantee the suitability, legality, or ability of any SFN Provider. You agree that ShipBob is not responsible or liable for the SFN Providers&rsquo; performance of the warehousing, pick and pack, or fulfillment services and that ShipBob does not guarantee any SFN Provider&rsquo;s compliance with applicable laws or regulations.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Carriers&rsquo; Responsibilities.</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>You understand and agree that ShipBob provides a technology platform connecting you with Carriers who are responsible for the actual shipping of your Goods. ShipBob shall use its proprietary technology to find the best available shipping option with a Carrier based upon the dimensions, desired speed, and final destination of the Order. ShipBob is not a carrier and does not itself ship or arrange to ship your Goods, nor do the Services include any shipping services.</li>
          <li>ShipBob will help facilitate the filing of claims with Carriers for Goods that are lost or damaged by a Carrier, but ShipBob is not responsible for any loss or damage caused by a Carrier. All such claims shall be subject to ShipBob&rsquo;s Lost in Transit and Damage Claims Policy.</li>
          <li>ShipBob will use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the Carrier&rsquo;s assent to the following terms: (a) that the Carrier has the necessary approvals, authorities, licenses, and insurance to provide the shipping services; (b) that the Carrier will comply with all federal, state, provincial, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances including, but not limited to, safety laws and regulations and (c) that the Carrier will maintain insurance as required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ShipBob will not assess or guarantee the suitability, legality, or ability of any Carrier. You agree that ShipBob is not responsible or liable for the Carriers&rsquo; performance of the shipping services and that ShipBob does not guarantee any Carriers&rsquo; compliance with applicable laws or regulations.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>

ShipBob hereby grants you a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and non-exclusive right and license (&ldquo;License&rdquo;) to use the object code of any Software, and Content on a single device solely in connection with the Services, provided that you shall not (and shall not allow any third party to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, or otherwise attempt to discover any source code or sell, assign, sublicense, or otherwise transfer any Content or right in any Software.

The License may be terminated immediately at ShipBob&rsquo;s sole discretion and shall, in any event, terminate upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</li>
          <li>You are solely responsible for all data, information, feedback, suggestions, text, content, and other materials that you upload, post, deliver, provide, or otherwise transmit or store in connection with or relating to the Services (&ldquo;Your Content&rdquo;). For every email sent outside of your organization via the Services, you acknowledge and agree that ShipBob shall have the right to automatically add an identifying footer in accordance with our policies.</li>
          <li>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login, password, Your Content, account, and for all activities that occur under your login or account. For support purposes, designated ShipBob employees have the ability to access your ShipBob accounts. This access includes but is not limited to production data, including Personally Identifiable Information (&ldquo;PII&rdquo;) within the dashboard and data storage locations. This access is audited on a regular basis as a part of ShipBob&rsquo;s internal audit processes. By posting Your Content on or through the Services, you hereby do and shall grant ShipBob a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, display, publish, and perform Your Content. ShipBob has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the Services, Content, and Your Content. You further agree that ShipBob may remove or disable any Content (including Your Content) at any time for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or Your Content), or for no reason at all.</li>
          <li>You understand that the operation of the Services, including Your Content, may be unencrypted and may involve (i) transmissions over various networks; (ii) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices; and (iii) transmission to ShipBob&rsquo;s third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate and maintain the Services. Accordingly, you acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for adequate security, protection, and backup of Your Content. ShipBob will have no liability to you for any unauthorized access or use of any of Your Content, or any corruption, deletion, destruction, or loss of any of Your Content, and you will indemnify and hold ShipBob harmless for any claims, damages, or liability related to Your Content.</li>
          <li>You own all of Your Content or have obtained all permissions, releases, rights, or licenses required to engage in your posting and other activities (and to allow ShipBob to perform its obligations) in connection with the Services without obtaining any further releases or consents. Your Content does not, and will not, violate, infringe, or misappropriate any third party&rsquo;s intellectual property or privacy rights, nor does Your Content contain any matter that is defamatory, obscene, unlawful, threatening, abusive, tortious, offensive, or harassing</li>
          <li>You shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access, or otherwise use the Services, including hardware, software, networks, and telephone service (collectively, &ldquo;Your Equipment&rdquo;). Your Equipment must comply with all specifications set forth in ShipBob&rsquo;s policies then in effect. You shall also be responsible for maintaining the security of Your Equipment, your Account, passwords (including but not limited to administrative and user passwords), files, and for all uses of your Account or Your Equipment with or without your knowledge or consent.</li>
          <li>You have no right to access ShipBob&rsquo;s physical facilities or property or any of the SFN Provider&rsquo;s physical facilities or property. Under no circumstances, and at no time, during the Term of this Agreement or after, are you permitted to enter ShipBob&rsquo;s or the SFN Providers&rsquo; facilities, fulfillment centers, or premises without prior express written notice by ShipBob or the SFN Provider. As your Goods may be commingled with the Goods of other merchants in ShipBob&rsquo;s or SFN Providers&rsquo; facilities, under no circumstances, during the Term or after, may you access the Goods while the Goods are stored in ShipBob&rsquo;s or SFN Providers&rsquo; facilities, without prior express written consent of ShipBob and the SFN Provider. If you are granted access, you will be monitored during the access period and your access can be terminated at ShipBob&rsquo;s or the SFN Provider&rsquo;s discretion.</li>
          <li>ShipBob reserves the right to use your name and/or company name as a reference for marketing or promotional purposes on ShipBob&rsquo;s Site and in other communication with existing or potential Merchants. To decline ShipBob this right you need to email support@shipbob.com stating that you do not wish to be used as a reference.</li>
          <li>ShipBob may provide, at ShipBob&rsquo;s sole discretion, technical support services, through email, chat, or telephone in accordance with our standard practice.</li>
          <li>ShipBob is not the Merchant of Record for any of your Goods or the importer of record for Goods stored at an SFN Provider. ShipBob shall not be held liable for complying with your instructions through the Services. You understand that ShipBob does not inspect your Goods nor does ShipBob take responsibility for the business decisions that you make and implement through the Services. For example, ShipBob cannot control or ensure that a buyer or seller with whom you do business will remit payment for Goods in accordance with your agreement with them.</li>
        </ol>

      <li>

        <h3>Service Fees.</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>&ldquo;Service Fees&rdquo; are the fees for any Services and any third-party fees (third-party fees include, but are not limited to, Carrier, SFN Provider, and other shipping fees, rates of duty, international brokerage charges, freight charges, insurance premiums, or other third-party charges incurred during your use of the Service).</li>

            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Quotations accepted through the ShipBob Platform are estimates based on the best information available at the time made. The final rates and Service Fees may vary based upon the Goods actually tendered, the work actually performed, or a number of factors such as Carrier shipping prices, the actual characteristics of your Goods, the delivery address, and service requested during the normal course of delivery. ShipBob reserves the right to bill the Service Fees based on actual charges at any time after the Services are rendered. ShipBob specifically disclaims liability for any Carrier shipping rate errors due to inaccurate or incomplete information provided to it, such as dimensions and weights.</li>

Carrier chargebacks are subject to additional administrative fees as specified in our Policies.</li>
          <li>You acknowledge and agree that all Service Fees, charges, and any other rates or amounts charged by ShipBob to you hereunder are exclusive of applicable value added, sales/use or inventory, CDT (as defined below) and service taxes (&ldquo;Transaction Taxes&rdquo;) which may be levied in connection with the supply by ShipBob of the Services to you. Where applicable, you shall pay all Transaction Taxes arising in respect of the Service Fees or other amounts charged to you by ShipBob.</li>

              <li>Upon receipt, ShipBob or SFN Provider may, at its sole discretion, verify the quantity of the Goods and inspect for any damage. You acknowledge and agree that ShipBob or SFN Provider has no obligation to verify the quantity, content, condition, or quality of the Goods delivered to SFN Provider&rsquo;s facility for storage and/or delivery.

              <li>ShipBob will facilitate fulfillment of the number of Orders which was communicated during onboarding every day. Additional time may be required for special kitting, picking or any alterations in regular process.</li>
              <li>ShipBob or SFN Providers, as applicable, shall thereafter process, package, and facilitate the shipment of all Orders by Carriers within one (1) business day of actual receipt of the Order from you provided that proper inventory amounts exist and there are no issues with the Order.

              <li>ShipBob will facilitate the increase of labor on hand to fulfill large Order drops on the same day.

                  <li>If at least 50% of stated order volume is placed, no charge and (2) if under 50% of stated Order volume is placed, a charge of $1.25 per Order for all Orders from the stated volume to the realized volume will be assessed to recoup labor costs. (For example, if you stated you would place 200 Orders and only placed 50 Orders, you would be assessed a fee of $187.50, with 150 Orders at $1.25 per Order).</li>

You agree and acknowledge that ShipBob has no obligation to verify any shipping addresses provided by you.</li>
          <li>If ShipBob provides an Order shipping estimate based on an address later discovered to be inaccurate or incomplete, you are solely responsible for any applicable address correction fees ShipBob incurs from the Carrier, any difference in Carrier shipping cost or for any other costs or fees due to the incomplete or inaccurate address.

        <h3>Service Level Agreement</h3>

International shipments that are not delivered are often returned by the Carrier and assessed return shipping, brokerage, and returns processing Carrier fees. These fees assessed by the Carriers are billed through to merchants, often without notice.

        <h3><strong>B2B Orders:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <ol>
              <li>For orders being shipped to a business (&ldquo;B2B Order&rdquo;), ShipBob allows the use of pre-paid labels or merchant-directed freight shipments. When submitting a B2B order for facilitation through ShipBob, the following conditions apply:
                <ol>
                  <li aria-level="4">ShipBob will notify you via email once a pre-paid parcel or Merchant-arranged freight order has been packed.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">After this notification, you will have five (5) business days to upload a shipping label for pre-paid parcel shipments or to have a freight provider pick up your Merchant-arranged freight order.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">After five (5) business days if the conditions in step 2 have not been met, you will be assessed a $25.00 fee per day for pre-paid parcel orders or a $50.00 fee per day for Merchant arranged freight orders.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">After five (5) business days from the time an order was packed, if you have not yet uploaded shipping labels for your parcel order or have not yet had a Carrier pick up your Merchant-arranged freight order, ShipBob will facilitate the restocking of your B2B order and you will be assessed a cancellation fee. This cancellation fee will be equal to the SFN Provider&rsquo;s total cost to prepare the order, including, but not limited to, pick fees, prepaid label fees, and any other costs incurred to prepare the order.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">If you cancel a B2B order after the SFN Provider has started to pick your B2B order, you will also incur the above cancellation fee in addition to the original fee to prepare your B2B order.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">ShipBob reserves the right to charge for a prepaid order once it has been packed.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">If the SFN Provider does not pack a B2B order within ShipBob&rsquo;s stated SLA, ShipBob will cover all costs if you provide proof of invoice for you having to reschedule freight, up to a maximum of $500.00. In this circumstance, ShipBob will not assess a late fee and also will arrange for the SFN Provider to hold the order for up to fifteen (15) business days before restocking, and restocking will be done free of cost. If the SFN Provider fails to pack an order within ShipBob&rsquo;s stated SLA, and you contact ShipBob to request a hold, ShipBob will arrange for the SFN Provider to hold the packed B2B order for up to thirty (30) calendar days.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">ShipBob, SFN Providers and Carriers shall not be responsible for any chargebacks, penalties, fines, or liquidated damages of any kind, including those from your customers.</li>
